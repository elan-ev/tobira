      **Welcome to Tobira!**

      Tobira is a video portal for [Opencast](https://opencast.org). Note that it is still
      in its *early* stages of development! Everything you see here might still change.
      Tobira is fully open source and you can find its source
      code [here](https://github.com/elan-ev/tobira).

      What you are seeing here is the most recent development build (the latest `master`)
      containing a bunch of dummy data. All text and videos you can see here are just for
      testing.
