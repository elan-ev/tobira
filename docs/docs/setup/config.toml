# Configuration for Tobira.
#
# All relative paths are relative to the location of this configuration file.
# Duration values are specified as string with a unit, e.g. "27s". Valid
# units: 'ms', 's', 'min', 'h' and 'd'.
#
# All user-facing texts you can configure here have to be specified per
# language, with two letter language key. Only English ('en') is required.
# Take `general.site_title` for example:
#
#     [general]
#     site_title.en = "My university"
#     site_title.de = "Meine Universität"
#

[general]
# The main title of the video portal. Used in the HTML `<title>`, as main
# heading on the home page, and potentially more.
#
# Required! This value must be specified.
#site_title =

# Public URL to Tobira (without path).
# Used for RSS feeds, as those require specifying absolute URLs to resources.
# 
# Example: "https://tobira.my-uni.edu".
#
# Required! This value must be specified.
#tobira_url =

# Terms and conditions that a user has to agree to in order to use Tobira.
# This consists of a title, a markdown rendered text explaining what a user
# is agreeing to, and a button label for confirmation.
# These can be specified in multiple languages.
# Consent is prompted upon first use and only if this is configured. It is
# re-prompted when any of these values change.
# 
# We recommend not to configure this unless absolutely necessary,
# in order to not degrade the user experience needlessly.
# 
# Example:
# 
# ```
# [general.initial_consent]
# title.en = "Terms & Conditions"
# button_label.en = "Agree"
# text.en = """
# To use Tobira, you need to agree to our terms and conditions:
# - [Terms](https://www.our-terms.de)
# - [Conditions](https://www.our-conditions.de)
# """
# ```
#initial_consent =

# Whether or not to show a download button on the video page.
#
# Default value: true

# Links that are shown in the footer.
#
# By overwriting this default value, you can remove the default links and
# add custom ones. Note that these two default links are special and can
# be specified with only the shown string. To add custom ones, you need
# to define a label and a link. The link is either the same for every language
# or can be specified for each language in the same manner as the label. 
# Example:
#
# ```
# footer_links = [
#     { label = { en = "Example 1" }, link = "https://example.com" },
#     { label = { en = "Example 2" }, link = { en = "https://example.com/en" } },

#     "http://my.domain/xml/namespace".courseLink = { en = "Course", de = "Kurs"}
#
# As you can see, this is a mapping of a metadata location (the XML
# namespace and the name) to a translated label. For the XML namespace
# URL, there is one shortcut: the "http://purl.org/dc/terms/" is
# abbreviated as just "dcterms".
#
# It's likely easier to write this as shown above (as extra section)
# instead of trying to cram it into one line (as shown below with the
# default value).
#
# Instead of the manually translated label, you can use some builtin
# labels like this:
#
#     [general.metadata]
#     dcterms.license = "builtin:license"
#     dcterms.source = "builtin:source"
#
# As soon as you add your own metadata fields, this default is
# overwritten. If you want to keep showing the license and source data,
# you have to add those two lines to your configuration.

# URL to Opencast. Currently used for all purposes (syncing, Studio,

# Some HTTP requests to Opencast contain the unencrypted `sync.password`,

#password =

# A rough estimate of how many items (events & series) are transferred in
# each HTTP request while harvesting (syncing) with the Opencast
# instance.
#
# A very large number might cause problems due to the Opencast or Tobira
# node having to hold that many items in memory, or due to network
# request size restrictions. Too small of a number means that the
# overhead of each request will become more significant, slowing down
# harvesting. But more importantly: if your Opencast instance has more
# items with exactly the same `updated` timestamp than the configured
# `preferred_harvest_size`, Tobira is unable to harvest. The `updated`
# timestamp is has millisecond precision, so this situation is highly
# unlikely to occur naturally. However, this can easily occur with
# artificial timestamps, like when you migrate old Opencast data
# (without an `updated` timestamp). Be aware of that.
