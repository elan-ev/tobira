# IDE/editor setup

We recommend using TypeScript and Rust language servers to ease development a lot.
For Rust, use [`rust-analyzer`](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) as it provides the best dev experience currently.
Language servers can be used in a large number of editors.
If you cannot decide, try Visual Studio Code, which provides a particularly high quality integration of language servers.
For Rust, [the IntelliJ plugin](https://intellij-rust.github.io/) is apparently also pretty good.

Make sure your IDE/editor strips trailing whitespace, uses UTF-8 encoding, indents with 4 spaces, and ensures a single trailing newline at the end of each file.
